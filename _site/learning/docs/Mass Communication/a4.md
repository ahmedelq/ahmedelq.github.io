# Persuasion 

Main goal: to change people's minds, attitudes and believes. 

## What makes a message persuasive ?

Researchers still unclear of an exact answer. 

## What is persuasion ?

According to (Simons, 1976) **persuasion is human communication designed to influence others by modifying their beliefs, values, and attitudes**. (Gass & Seiter, 1999) defines it as "**When source transmit a message to an audience through channel with the purpose of changing an attitude**".

## Persuasion in mass media

* Persuasion was used in WW1,WW2, and Nazi propaganda.
* Persuasion is not a simple linear stimulus-response type process, but rather a more complicated one. 

## Persuasion is not a simple process 

### Hovland's perspective

Describes a set of processes that influence a person:

1. **Attention**
2. **Comprehension**: the message must be understood.
3. **Acceptance**
4. **Retention**: remembering the message. 

A message acceptance depends on 3 main parts:  

1. **Audience**: age, attention, social, educational level, etc.. 
2. **Source**: credibility (have high or low trustworthiness + Expertise) and attractiveness (Liking). 
3. **Content**: message quality and order of arguments. 

### Lazarsfeld's perspective 

* peoples choice 
* mediating role of opinion leaders

## Case study (Ads)

Advertisements are a direct example of persuasion, companies use celebrities, doctors, etc... 

## Major constructs of persuasive communication 

### Credibility - Believability of a communicator

**Expertise**, whether the source **knows the truth**, what is right or correct. 
**Trustworthiness**: whether the source is **inclined to tell the truth** as they see it.

We believe the credibility of a source when both the expertise and trustworthiness are high. 

### Liking

Likable source can deliver a message more persuasively. 

### Similarity

How similar you and the target source is. The effect will only take place when you **like** the communicator

* Similarity -> liking -> effect
* **Attitudinal similarity**: in terms on controversial issues
* **Categorical similarity**: nationality, allegiance, sexuality, etc..

The attitudinal similarity may be more effective than the former.

### Attractiveness

physical attractiveness indirectly leads to persuasion, when the audience **likes** the communicator.  

### Halo effect

Having a positive evaluations towards a person.

### [Sleeper effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeper_effect)

The association between source and message becomes weaker and weaker over time. You will remember the message but you may forget who delivered it. 

### Source

#### Ordinary individuals

* Expertise vs. Trustworthiness
* Perceived identification

#### Celebrities

*  Halo effect
* Long-term effect: to build consistent and coherent images
* Source > message issue

#### Experts  

* Expertise vs. trustworthiness 
* Halo effect

## Elaboration likelihood model 

[ELM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elaboration_likelihood_model) is a very important model in persuasion

motivational & capability --> attitude change (persistence) 

* The central route: involves deep and detailed thinking about the arguments. (Robust & persistent attitude)
* The peripheral route: relying on superficial cues without thoughtful consideration of the arguments  (Weak attitude)

### Route selection

The central route is taken when

* issues is of relevance
* aware of persuasion 

The peripheral route is taken when 

* lack motivation
* inability to think about the arguments 

### Class Notes

if you lack the motivation and capability then it is 

* source effect and topic involvement
* elaboration likelihood model (ELM; petty & cacioppo, 1986)
* Motivation & relevance
* Ability
* Quality of the message is important to take the central route
* if we took the central route then we become robust (resistance to change)
* if we process through the peripheral route (either because we lack motivation or ability), we may form attitude that is weak and predisposed to change.

### Strong message elements

* **Personal relevance**: high,low. you take the central route when it is high. 
* **Argument quality**: high,low.
* **Source of information**: high,low.
