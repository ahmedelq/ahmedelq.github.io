# Parasocial Interaction

[para](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/para-) is a greek prefix means "beyond" or "near".

Parasocial interaction refers to a psychological phenomena that occurs when a mass media viewer develops an  illusionary interaction with the displayed personalities.

In plain text: a fake relationship one possess to a media figure (e.g Harry potter). 

## Parasocial Interaction

An illusionary experience such that media audiences interact with persons (e.g talk show hosts, celebrities, fictional characters) as if they are engaged in a reciprocal relationship with them, and feel as though a mediated other is talking directly to them.

* Intimacy at a distance (Horton & Whol, 1956).
* PSI as immediate , personal and reciprocal but these qualities are illusory (Horton & Strauss, 1957): a **character is talking to me**, which isn't real.

## Parasocial interaction vs Relationship

Parasocial interaction is  a one-way perception "**imagined interaction with a media figure through a discrete viewing session** ", while Parasocial  Relationship (PSR) is "**an on-going one sided bound with a media figure**", which can be a long-term  

After constantly being bombarded/exposed to media, parasocial interaction (PSI) can develop into parasocial relationship (PSR).

## Interpersonal / Mass

"one of the most striking characteristics of the **mass media is that they give the illusion of face-to-face relationship** with the performer"

It is a mass communication phenomena:  

We learn about people by observing their gesture, voice tone, conversation to different situation. We accumulate knowledge about them and know them. By doing this **over time**, we reduce uncertainty; and gain more understanding and predictability. This is exactly applicable to mass media character.

## Parasocial contact hypothesis

Contact hypothesis: interpersonal contact as an effective way to remove stereotype and prejudice of out-group. 

It is extremely hard to modify or change your stereotypes and prejudice, one of the ways to change this is to have an interpersonal contact. 

In order for that to happen these criteria must hold:

* When interpersonal contact is **not consistent with preexisting stereotype**, people feel dissonance.
* When interpersonal contact with an out-group occurs frequently in various social contexts
* When interpersonal contact occurs with **representative out-group members**

With no or minimal direct experience, media exposure may replace interpersonal contact.
Example, changing attitudes towards sexual minorities: watching 'six feet under' for 5 weeks **changes in views attitudes** on gays and lesbians. 

## Parasocial To Social 

computer-mediated communication changed the way people interact and communicate with each other. 

With mass media it is parasocial interaction, but with social media it is social interaction.
