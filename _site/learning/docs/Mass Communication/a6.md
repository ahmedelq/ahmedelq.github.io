![Image result for emotion mood and affect](https://recatschool.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/activation.png)

## Mood management theory (MM)

Argues that people use media to eliminate negative emotion and increase positive state. It assumes two things: People want to reduce negative emotions, 2. people want to increase and maintain positive emotions.

### Uses & Gratification vs. MM 

* MM posits that affective states, rather than general needs determine media / message selection. 
* Not only general features of a genre, specific attributes (e.g the degree of arousal) matter. 
* MM does not assume people are aware of their needs and motivations, it have a different methodology to test predictions.  (instead of surveys, they use experiments)

### Bryant & Zillman experiment (1984)

Got 2 groups, [...]

* Manipulating the defree of stress -> watching TV for 15 minutes
  * Those under low stress -> arousing TV program
  * Under high stress -> less arousing TV program
* **people utilize media to keep optimal states**.

when people are stressed out they watch relaxed and exciting programs 

## Negative aspects of game

People play games applications more than any other application. 

### Negative perception of a game

When you play a game you are impressed, you are part of it hence you will have greater effect as compared to TV. Games increase   in violent and sexual games. 

Development of computer graphics audio techniques -> realistic portrayal. Increased User engagement through interactivity -> greater effect  compared to TV or any other mass media. Various social issues are caused by game addictions. 

### Casual relationship between violent content and violence

[Zillmann & Weaver (1999)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1999-08085-008) did an experiment, in it divided two groups, a group watched a violent content, and the other a non-violent. They were asked to identify facial expression of people to give a positive or a negative feedback. And evaluating a reasarch assistant.  

shows that watching violent content increases.

Mechanisms: media exposures & effects

Social learning theory -> learning from obesrvation

Priming -> exposure to violent/sexual content -> activation of relation emotions and violent/sexual behaviors

Arousal - arousal through violent/sexual content exposure intensified following emotional reaction. 

Desensitization repeated exposure to violent/sexual content desintified reaction to violence /sexual content/victim.

### Persuasion through entertainment education

"A stratgy using popular entertainemnt media to educate audiences." -Singhal & Rogers, 2001 
it increases intrinsic motivations and involvement. (they are smokers but they don't realize it, because only on social circumstances)

### Interactive tailoring

More likely to read, understand, recalled, and perceived as trustworthy / greater potential for persuasion, compared to non-tailored messages. Games provide tailored messages + interactive feedback.
