# My philosophy 
In order to understand something, you better explain it.
From another perspective, it is an attempt to apply the following principle

> When a man dies, his deeds come to an end, except for three: A continuous charity, **knowledge by which people derive benefit**, pious son who prays for him. - Mohammed

## Thou shalt conquer

> Veni, vidi, vici

During his twenties, Alexander the Great, defeated the mighty Persian empire and conquered most of the old world. Alas, the time of strong men is over, men today are weak, lazy, fragile, and worst of all easily hurt and offended, the symptoms described by Nietzsche in [last man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_man). The meaning of existence is to become the best version of yourself (exert *der Wille zur Macht*), and you can not do that without obtaining knowledge.
