# Uses and Gratifications (UGT)

[UGT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uses_and_gratifications_theory) is an audiance centered approach to understand mass media. it foucses on why people use media, rather than what do media does to people. it argues that people seek out specific media to satisfy their needs, the individual has the power to  choose media source to satisfy their needs to achieve gratification.   

### What people do with the media ? 

- What the media do to people -> what people do with the media ?  why they choose that medium ? 
- Moderate to powerful media effect
- Katz (1959)
  - Media-centered  -> audience-centered perspective 
  - persuasive influence of mass communication -> how people use media to improve their lives ?

### Needs, motivation, and media

- **Cognitive needs**: desire to know, understand and solve problems. 
  need for cognition : psychological measure for each individual, incline to interact with congnition problems i.e: solve problems, puzzles, mathematical problems, etc... (need for cognition scale)
- **Affective needs**: emotional reactions, like watching sad motive or comedy shows, thrillers, music...
- **Personal integrative needs** (self-esteem): assure your self-esteem. you want to make sure you are better. for example: engage in donations, watching religion shows. There is **[downward/upward social comparison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_comparison_theory#Upward_and_downward_social_comparisons)** 
- **Social integrative needs**: facebook or twitter, (someone watches a baseball to interact with others who loves with baseballs)
- **Tension release needs**: vent about the political or economical situation. 

### User and gratifications approach

- Individual differences cause each audience member to seek out different messages, use them differently and respond to them uniquely.
- Assumes viewers actively choose media content to gratify individual needs.
- Examines motivations and behavior of viewers

### Uses of gratifications

* Gratification Obtained < sought  ==> change the activity 
* Gratification Obtained >= sought ==> grater gratifications.   you will keep watching (engaging)

### The assumptions of U&G (important)

- The audience is active and its media use is goal-oriented. (use media to achieve their goals)
- The initiative in liking need gratification to a specific medium choice rests with the audience member (you made the decision to choose media)
- The media compete with other resources for need satisfaction (e.g hanging with freinds)
- People have enough self-awareness of their media use, interests and motives to be able to provide researchers with an accurate picture of that use (people are aware of what they want)
- Value judgments of media content can only be assessed by the audience (media satisfaction is only determined by you) 

 

### Uses and gratifications contributions

- Active audience
- It explains why media use differs across individuals 
- The bright side of media use

### Criticisim

- Too individualisitc 

- Are people indeed aware of their motivations/needs ? 

- Lack of predictability; the aussumptions can not be tested, has zero value in predicting things.
