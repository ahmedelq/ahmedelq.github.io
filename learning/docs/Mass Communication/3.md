# Limited effects media

Contrary to Hypodermic Needles Theory, limited effects suggests that people can not be influenced through media

## Two-step flow model 

[Lazarsfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Lazarsfeld) an American sociologist, made a big research and went to Ohaio state. where he did a long term research and asked the population before election what do they think about x,y,z, and what do they read. he found that democratic people only follow democratic news, and so on. They found that media are not as effective as people thought.

The two-step flow model suggests that: media has little to no effect on constructing people's opinion, rather, the opinion is developed through interpersonal communication with [*opinion leaders*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_leadership) which are influenced by the media. 

- Criticized the powerful media effect perspective - people's choice studies
  - How media affect voter's mind 
  - Media reinforces pre-existing attitudes rather than changing them.
- employed scientific approaches 
- media are not as effective as people believe

more often people are affected by individuals than mass media. 

You ==> Leaders (source of influence) ==> Mass Media

### Drawbacks

* There could be several stages rather than two.  

## 

## **[Selective exposure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_exposure_theory)**

People voluntarily expose themselves with content that aligns with their thoughts; searching for evidence to support their arguments and thoughts while avoiding other contradicting media outlets. 

* **[selective retention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_retention)**: people remember things that are closer to their beliefs.

A process of nonrandom selection of media related alternatives. 
Individuals have a large degree of control over how mass media affect them.

## Klapper's generalizations (1960)

"mass communication ordinarily does not serve as a necessary and sufficient cause of audience effects, but rather functions among and through a nexus of mediating factors and influences." ==> opinion leaders

"mass communication as a contributorily agent but not the sole cause in a process of reinforcing the existing conditions "

- Media is ineffective compared to other influencing social and psychological factors such social status, group, education, etc..
- The media acts merely to reinforce one's opinions, and not change them.

DRAWBACK: focuses only on changing one's attitude.



III. The moderate to powerful media effect paradigm

Not only changing people's attitude, but also giving them a platform to express their ideas.

Mass media gives which issues are important

- 1960s-1970s
  - Introduction of TV: easily understandable, even to people who can't understand 
  - Media reach greater number of people
  - Long-term accumulated effects of media
- Mendelsohn (1973) - powerful effects of media
