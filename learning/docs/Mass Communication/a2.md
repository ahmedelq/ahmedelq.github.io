## The thoery argument

Humans fear of isolation and opinion climate, they want first to see how others think abou the issue before formulating an opinion (opinion climate)

People can detect opinion climate (Qusai-statical sense); able to detect others opinions even if it takes time and energy, they speak out openly if were the majoirty of the people, on the other hand be slient if on the minority side.

People voice their opinions in public when they feel they are in a majority but remain silent when they feel they are in a minorty. 

Reasons: 

* Avoid isolation
* Conformity pressure (as in Asch's experiment)
* Desire to be a victor

## Spiral of silince 

* the issue becomes less [...]

## The roles of media

### Ubiquity

Media is everywhere

### Cumulation 

Media content is repittive and covered multiple times 

### Consonance

The congurence, similarity held by news people affect the content they produce.

## The role of the Internet

Does the Internet make minorities speak out ? Yes, and no. anonymoty faciliates self-expression but the theory may still hold in some cases, opinion climate is visible and more evident. 

Collectivism & indivialaislm 

* Korea vs. Germany 
  * User commnet: congurent, inconguremnt, split, no comment
  * User attribute: collectivism, individualism

Koreans are collectivist country while germany is more invididualistic, the resutls showed no difference.



## Minority influence

What makes minorty influential ? 

### Compliance

Public acceptance but private rejection. As in the elevator experiment, they accpet the behavior publicaly but may not change it.

### Conversion

Public and private acceptance, with consistency, confidence in the correctness, appearing to be unbiased, and resisting social pressure and abuse.
