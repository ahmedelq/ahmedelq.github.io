# Priming

[Priming theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priming_(media)) suggests that media content triggers (stimulates) related thoughts that led to a judgment. That is, one thought can lead to other thoughts. it is rooted on the premise that human memory is a set of connected nodes; related concepts are connected in some mental network, so that if one concept is activated, then concepts related to it are also activated.

In plain text, media shows an aspect to let the audience judge based on previous related information. 

## Example: Bush approval

* Bush overall approval rating – 71%
  * Approval of handling of economy – 49%
  * Approval of handling of taxes – 52%
  * Approval of handling war in Iraq – 71%  

Priming occurs when a certain aspect (handling war for example) is shown, it would then be associated with Bush, when someone rates Bush, the first thought that comes to mind is handling the war rather than economy or taxes.  



## Priming effects

- Information or thoughts are linked with each other, when one of them is activated, the relevant ones (thoughts, attitudes, memories) can also be activated. 
- Activation of relevant information is faster and easier
- Irrelevant information is deactivated
- Priming can occur without awareness (Bargh et al., 1996)
- Primed ideas may affect even our behavior 
- (Bargh, Chen & Burrows, 1996 ) polite and un-polite.

## Mass communication and priming 

- The effects of prior stimuli on following information processing
- The cognitive effect of media content
- media violence and priming
  - watching content may activate violent perception
  - Word association exercise 

 

## Variables that enhance priming effects

- The perceived meaning of the communication 
- The perceived justifiability
- The extent to which audiences identify with the characters
- The perceived reality of the mediated communication 
- The stimulus of prior experience 

## Communication and Priming

- priming effects are closely related to communication
- Some criticism
  - Controllability - can we induce / manipulate priming effects ?
  - Media do much more than simple activation 
  - Underestimate the role of media
