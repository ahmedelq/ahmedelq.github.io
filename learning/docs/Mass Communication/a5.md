Cont. Persuasion 

## Major constructs of persuasive communication mesesage

### One sided vs. Two sided messages

* **One-sided**: Presenting argument supporting the advocated view. only persuades audience with the same view. 
* **Two-sided**: A message that presents supporting view of a statement but also acknowledges the opposite view.

Research shows the two persuasion ways have the same results. 

### Refutational two-sided vs. Non-reflectional two-sided

more effective than one-sided, and non-reflectional two-sided, 
in two-sided reflectional message it mentions opposing reasons, and also WHY it is incorrect. 



### Discrepancy

Effect of persuasion=y-axis, and Discrepancy (your own position and the message)=x-axis

results in an inverted u-shaped curve, in the peak lies the credibility or personal relevance. 

The greater the discrepancy in the message the greater change in attitude.

### Fear appear message 

Can messages that frighten you, change your mind ? absolutely, but it is a complicated process.  

The effects of fear appeal: EPPM (extended parallel processing model) explains it nicely:

1. First assess if the message is relevant, how severe is it for you ? 
   1. if no, then you stop processing and reject the message.
2. if yes, can you do something about it (efficacy), can you handle it ? 
   1. if no, you will be in fear, so you want to control it (emotions).
3. if yes, you will accept the message and consequently change your behavior.

## Attitude & behavior

if you have a positive vibe about a thing you will adopt it, buy it, etc.. In other words, your behavior is predicted upon your attitude. 

### Compliance gaining

focuses on behavioral changes rather than attitude and behavior as in persuasion. 

#### Door-in-the face

You overestimate your original request, then it gets rejected. you re-propose with the original request which may have more chances now to be accepted. (Example: give-and-take) 

#### Fear-then-relief

Dolinski, a polish  researcher, did an experiment, pretending to give parked cars with a ticket, then when the driver comes he sees an advertiser for donation instead. 

effect of mindless (???): can i make a copy for 3 pages ? vs 320 pages.
