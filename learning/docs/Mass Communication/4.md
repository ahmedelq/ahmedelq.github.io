### Social learning theory

People learn things in two different ways: 

- **Inactive learning**: direct experience.

  - Sometimes its dangerous
  - takes a lot of time 

- **Vicarious learning**: indirect experience

  - knowledge is expended from previous cases like smoking. 
  - safe

  Social learning theory is involved with vicarious learning: how people learn with other's experience.

  The process of vicarious learning:

  - Modeling
    - **Attention**: pay attention to a model (action), observe --> imitate behavior.   
    - **Retention**: take a mental picture of it, remember aspects of the behavior. 
    - **Motor reproduction**: practice, to master certain skill. (talking mental and verbal representations into overt behavior- practice observed behavior)
      - Feedback is received during this stage. 
    - **Motivation**: incentives makes people pay more attention, retain more information. 

Example driving a car

### "Bobo doll" exerpience

Bandura, Ross (1961) conducted an experience in which children were watching an adult beating a Bobo doll.
Children imitated (adopted)  the violent behavior. 
The study suggests that children can learn aggressive behavior

at the time people thoughts watching crimes on TV would reduce it, but in fact the resutlts contradected the studies. 

### The importance of motivation 

motivation - own intention to perform a behavior 

- Incentives to motivate 
  - positive outcome experienced
  - observation of the other's successful behavior 
  - affirmation of personal standards of behavior 

### According to Bandura

The importance of rewards and punishment
watching two different videos 

- video 1: after the aggressive behavior, individuals in the video received rewards
- video 2: after the aggressive behavior, individuals in the videos got punished 

children who watched the video met bobo doll
greater imitation behavior in the reward condition 

### Effects of modeling 

- **Inhibitory effects**: new information or observation of new behavior acts to restrain previously learned behavior
- **Disinhibitory effects** : newly added information or behavior acts to remove internal restraints. (quite smoking)

### Learning from Media

- The role of media is social learning 
- Social construction of reality
  - effects of viewing violence on behavior 
- Learning good things - various positive learning effects evident from viewing educational TV.
