People learn in two ways: Inactive learning : direct experience: sometimes its dangerous and takes a lot of time. Vicarious learning : Indirect experience; knowledge is expended from previous cases like smoking it is much safer. Social learning theory is involved with vicarious learning: how people learn with other's experience. From Wikipedia : Social learning theory is a theory of learning process and social behavior which proposes that new behaviors can be acquired by observing and imitating others. [...] When a particular behavior is rewarded regularly, it will most likely persist; conversely, if a particular behavior is constantly punished, it will most likely desist. The process of vicarious learning: Modeling Attention : observing a behavior (model) accurately. Retention : take a mental picture of it, remember aspects of the behavior. Motor reproduction : practice, to master certain skill. (talking mental and verbal representations into overt behavior- practice observed behavior), self-correctness feedback by others is received during this stage to improve the performance. Motivation : incentives makes people pay more attention, retain more information. Example driving a car \"Bobo doll\" experience Bandura, Ross (1961) conducted an experience in which children were watching an adult beating a Bobo doll. Children imitated (adopted) the violent behavior. The study suggests that children can learn aggressive behavior at the time people thoughts watching crimes on TV would reduce it, but in fact the results contradicted the studies. The importance of motivation motivation - own intention to perform a behavior Incentives to motivate: positive outcome experienced observation of the other's successful behavior affirmation of personal standards of behavior Reward and punishment According to Bandura: The importance of rewards and punishment video 1: after the aggressive behavior, individuals in the video received rewards video 2: after the aggressive behavior, individuals in the videos got punished children who watched the video had greater imitation in the reward condition. Effects of modeling Inhibitory effects : new information or observation of new behavior acts to restrain previously learned behavior (e.g: quite smoking). Disinhibitory effects : newly added information or behavior acts to remove internal restraints.

A medium in which each entity (device) can share and/or receive a resource via a connection link . Connection links could be copper wires, optic fiber cables, radiowaves (WiFi) and so on. To understand each other, Protocols set a common understanding among these devices in the communication. The Internet can be described in two ways: what it is composed of (nuts and bolts) how it is layed-out (infrastructure) Nuts-and-bolts The Internet is a computer network that interconnects billions of computers (devices) around the world which are called hosts or end systems . These end systems are connected by connection links (e.g: copper wire, fiber, radio) and packet switches . When an end-system A decides to sent data to end-system B, first the data is decomposed into several chunks and a header is added to each chunk resulting in a packet , which is sent to B where it gets assembled again to form the original data. The connection links (e.g: cables, fibers, or radio spectrum) are limited with a transmission rate (bit-rate or data-rate) which is measured in bits/second. Packet switch Takes a packet from an incoming communication-link and deliver it to an outgoing communication-link. The route or path is the journey of switches and connection links in which a packet takes to arrive to its destination. There are two types of packet switches: Router : typically found at the core of the network, It forwards a packet to the destination end-system through networks using IP address. To do so, It consults its routing table to find the appropriate outbound communication-link, these routing tables are obtained using routing protocols ; which can also determine the optimal path (in distance and cost). Link-layer switch : provides access to a network, minimize costs and simplifies connection; removes the burden of linking each end-system to another end-system with a link. they operate under the link layer. Connected to a router to communicate with other networks. A good analogy Packet = Truck Communication-link = Roads & highways Switches = Intersections End-systems = Warehouses End-systems access the internet through Internet Service Providers (ISP) , these ISPs are in turn are composed of communication-links, link-layer switches, and routers. ISPs are connected with other national and internationl upper-tier ISPs with high speed routers and optic-fiber communication links. End-systems and the core of the internet confirm to Protocols during communication to specify sending and receiving of data, Internet Standards are consensus protocols to inter-cooperate different devices. which are documented in request for comments (RFC) documents. Infrastructure Looking at the Internet from another perspective, as an \"infrastructure\" to the distributed applications (e.g: http, mail, etc...) that runs over the end-systems and utilize socket interface a set of rules specifies how these applications should interact over the Internet. Internet Protocols A protocol is a set of agreements between communication parties, specifies the format , and order (sequence) of the exchanged messages. And the resulting actions upon receiving a message or an event. For example when humans interact, one can ask for the time by first saying \"hi\", the other person might reply with a greeting \"hi\" or might not even reply (didn't hear the sender, ignorant, etc...) in which case the other person would not proceed with a question, otherwise he would ask \"what is the time ?\", a reply with answer might come. The same is applicable to networks; to visit a webpage for example, your computer must first establish a connection with the server, after which you would ask the server to give you the webpage file, and it would be returned to you afterwards. The Network Edge Internet can be decomposed into two folds: Core Network: switches and routers. Edge Network: connected devices. The edge of the network is where devices (servers, computers, smart-phones, fridges, etc...) reside hence the name end-systems . Also called hosts because they \"host\" an application (web browser or server, email browser or server, etc...) Hosts can be further subdivided into: Client : Computer requesting a service (PCs, smartphones, laptops) Servers : Powerful computers that serve clients requests. 1.2.1 Access Network End-systems can be connected to the Internet via an edge-router . can come in many flavors notably: Digital-subscriber-line (DSL): translates digital data to high frequency tones via a modem to be transmitted through a telephone line to the ISP's central office where they are decoded again to digital format by a Digital subscriber line access multiplexer (DSLAM). The DSL link carries the telephone signals at 0-4 kHz, upstream 4-50 kHz, downstream 50 kHz - 1 MHz. Hence the connection is asymmetrical since upstream < downstream. Cable Internet Access: encoding digital data into a TV cable same idea as above. Fiber to the home (FTTH). 1.2.2 TBC The Internet Core Packet switching An application message is broken down into chunks called packets , they are forwarded to the destination through communication-links and switches, while a packet is being received by a switch its stored (buffered) in the switch before being sent to the next outbound link when it has been fully received, a technique called store-and-forward . Assuming the packet is of length L bits and and communication-link transmission rate is R , then the time it takes to send a packet from source end-system/switch to another end-system/switch is L/R . Sending a packet through N switches Without considering other delays, the time (in s) it takes for a packet of length L (bits) to be sent through N communication-links each having R ( (bits/s) transmission rate is: $$ N(L/R) $$ Circuit switching Unlike packet switching where a link is shared between multiple devices, in circuit switching the resources (link and buffer) are dedicated to two end-points during the connection session. It is sometimes inefficient since the full capacity of a communication-link is not utilized, but it is faster since there are no queues, the sender can send data at the speed of the allocated transmission rate. 1.3.3 TBC Delay, Loss, and Throughput Total nodal delay = nodal processing delay + queuing delay + transmission delay + propagation delay Nodal processing delay The time it takes to process a packet; to calculate the header, check errors and determine the next outbound link, which is then queued there. Queuing delay A packet is queued (stored) if the communication-link is occupied sending another packet. it will wait for its turn in the queue before being sent, this waiting time is called queuing delay and is variable to the earlier packets waiting for their turns; it increases if faced with high traffic. if the queue is empty, the queue delay is 0.

[Problem1] Consider a highway that has a tollbooth every 100 kilometers, as shown below. You can think of the highway segments between tollbooths as links and the tollbooths as routers. Suppose that cars travel (that is, propagate) on the highway at a rate of 50 km/hour (that is, when a car leaves a tollbooth, it instantaneously accelerates to 50 km/hour and maintains that speed between tollbooths). Suppose next that 20 cars, traveling together as a caravan, follow each other in a fixed order. You can think of each car as a bit and the caravan as a packet. Also suppose that each tollbooth services (that is, transmits) a car at a rate of one car per 15 seconds, and that it is late at night so that the caravan\u2019s cars are the only cars on the highway. Finally, suppose that whenever the first car of the caravan arrives at a tollbooth, it waits at the entrance until the other nineteen cars have arrived and lined up behind it. (Thus the entire caravan must be stored at the tollbooth before it can begin to be forwarded.) A . Suppose the caravan travels 300km, beginning in front of one tollbooth, passing through a second and third tollbooth, and finishing just after a fourthtollbooth. What is the end-to-end delay? B . Repeat (a), now assuming that there are sixteencars in the caravan instead of twenty [Solution1] : A The transmission rate at a tollbooth is $R={1\\:car}/{15s}$, hence the transmission delay in a one tollbooth is $d_{trans} = 20\\:car \\cdot \\frac{15 s}{1car} = 300s$, and since there are 3 tollbooths along the way, total transmission delay is $300 \\cdot 3 = 900s \\implies 15 \\:min$. The cars propagate $300km$ at speed of $50km/1hr$ , hence the propagation delay is $d_{prop}=300km\\cdot\\frac{1hr}{50km}=6\\:hrs$ Therefore, $d_{end-to-end}=d_{trans} + d_{prop} = 6\\;hours : 15\\:minutes$ B The transmission rate at a tollbooth is $R={1\\:car}/{15s}$, hence the transmission delay in a one tollbooth is $d_{trans} = 16\\:car \\cdot \\frac{15 s}{1car} =240s$, and since there are 3 tollbooths along the way, total transmission delay is $240s \\cdot 3 = 12 \\:min$. The car propagation delay didn't change since the speed is still the same, hence it is still $d_{prop}=6\\:hrs$ Therefore, $d_{end-to-end}=d_{trans} + d_{prop} = 6\\;hours : 12\\:minutes$ [Problem2] Consider two hosts, A and B, connected by a single link of rate R bps. Suppose that the two hosts are separated by m meters, and suppose the propagation speed along the link is s meters/sec. Host A is to send a packet ofsize L bits to Host B A.Express the propagation delay, dprop, in terms of m and s B.Determine the transmission time of the packet, dtrans, in terms of L and R C.Ignoring processing and queuing delays, obtain an expression for the end-to-end delay D.Suppose Host A begins to transmit the packet at time t = 0. At time t = dtrans, where is the last bit of the packet? E.Suppose dprop, is greater than dtrans. At time t = dtrans, where is the first bit of the packet? F.Suppose dpropis less than dtrans. At time t = dtrans, where is the first bit of the packet? G.Suppose s = 2\u00d7108, L = 150bits, and R = 60kbps. Find the distance m so that dpropequals dtrans [Solution2] $$ A.\\,\\:d_{prop}=m\\:meter \\times \\frac{1\\:sec}{s\\:meter} = {m}/{s} \\: sec $$ $$ B.\\,\\:d_{trans}=L\\:bit \\times \\frac{1\\:sec}{R\\:bit} = {L}/{R} \\: sec $$ $$ C.\\,\\:d_{end-to-end}= d_{prop} + d_{trans} \\: sec $$ $$ \\text{D.} \\,\\: \\text{Have just been pushed by A to the link.} $$ $$ \\text{E.

Also suppose each user requires 200 kbps when transmitting, but each user transmits only 5 percent of the time. A.When circuit switching is used, how many users can be supported? B.Suppose there are 100 users. Find the probability that at any given time, exactly n users are transmitting simultaneously. (Hint: Use the binomial distribution.) Solution3 A . Since each user should be allocated with $200kbps$ and the link is limited with $6Mbps$ the maximum number of possible users is: $$ \\frac{6\\times10^6 bps}{200 \\times 10^3bps/user} = 30 \\:user $$ B . We want to know where $n$ users out of $100$ are using the link at the same time, each user has probability of $0.05$ of transmitting (success) and 0.95 of not transmitting (failure), this is a binomial distribution problem given by: $$ {} {100}C {n} = (0.05)^n \\cdot (0.95)^{100-n} $$ [Problem4] In modern packet-switched networks, including the Internet, the source host segments long, application-layer messages (for example, an image or a musicfile) into smaller packets and sends the packets into the network. The receiverthen reassembles the packets back into the original message. We refer to thisprocess as message segmentation. Below image illustrates the end-to-endtransport of a message with and without message segmentation. Consider amessage that is 12\u00d7106bits long that is to be sent from source to destination inbelow image. Suppose each link in the figure is 2 Mbps. Ignore propagation,queuing, and processing delays. A. Consider sending the message from source to destination without message segmentation. How long does it take to move the message from the source host to the first packet switch? Keeping in mind that each switch uses store-and-forward packet switching, what is the total time to move the message from source host to destination host? B.Now suppose that themessage is segmented into 3000packets, with each packet being 4,000 bits long. How long does it take to move the first packet from source host to the first switch? When the first packet is being sent from the first switch to the second switch, the second packet is being sent from the source host to the first switch. At what time will the second packet be fully received at the first switch? C.How long does it take to move the file from source host to destination host when message segmentation is used? Compare this result with your answer in part (A) and comment. Solution4 A. Time required to reach the first switch: $\\frac{12\\:\\text{MB}}{2\\:\\text{Mbps}} = 6s$, since we have 3 links with the same speed the total time is $3 \\times 6s = 18s$ B. Time required to reach the first switch $\\frac{4000\\:\\text{bit}}{2\\times10^6\\:\\text{bps}} = 0.002s$, the second packet would be fully received after packet 1 is fully received by switch #2, that is after $0.004s$. C. Because the transmission is consecutive, each packet takes $0.002s$, Additionally It will take the first packet $0.002s$ to reach the first router, and $0.002s$ for the last packet to reach the destination hence the whole message would take $(3000\\times 0.002) + 0.002 + 0.002 = 6.004s$ to reach the destination.
