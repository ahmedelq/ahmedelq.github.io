In my pocket, I carry a tiny blackhole with me. Or in fact, it carries me. It carries me to fictitious worlds and distorted realities. It swallows my time whenever I touch it. The bright box with its carefully engineered notifications and glamorous colors had been hijacking me unconsciously for years. My ancient brain parts were seduced and manipulated by the far from truth virtual "social" environments (VSE). Connected virtually, absent physically, that was my modus-operandi at every social event: staring at whatever pixels spitted by the bright-box with my back hunched. It wasn't until a late 2017 epiphany that placed things into perspective: 1. ‘Scrolling’ is more of an addictive status-signaling game than a socializing mechanism. 2. Long exposures to VSEs can instill herd mentality.

## Technology must serve us, not the opposite

13 years ago, a phone had a clear purpose: to make calls, send brief SMS messages, or perhaps take mediocre pictures. This purpose was to be derailed after the emergence of the first iPhone in 2007, as it revolutionized and redefined the phone into a versatile device: virtually anything is a few clicks away. Although this new property proved useful in many ways, it ultimately backfired when combined synergistically with the desires of our lizard brains.

Many attention-jockeying apps were psychologically engineered to exploit this combination. Our social-hungry brains were turned into frantic validation-seeking addicts, while they're kept awash with rewarding chemicals. 'Scrolling' is conceptualized as an act of social interaction and its currency is our attention and private data. The product is us.

The otherwise luring manipulated utopic scenes rendered by the VSEs make the perception of real life as painfully bleak and unflavored, the number of followers accentuates social status, self-acceptance and validation is chained by the number of retweets, likes or upvotes one receives.

Even when Maslow's basic needs are met, we are no longer seeking self-actualization as much as we are eager to get the validation and approval of others - a thirst that will never be quenched.

Their effortlessly attainable instantaneous pseudo-accomplishments are slowly substituting the desire to achieve any serious work, and even if achieved it remains tasteless unless its shown and embraced in the VSE. 

 

## Think outside the box 

Oftentimes, the notion of truth [^Note 1] is not concluded, it is adopted. And much of what is adopted is a result of long and unconscious media bombardment. The sheer simplicity of the perceived agenda doesn't only make our malleable spongy brains good at absorbing them but also thinking they're uniquely ours. Deceived, therefore, we alter our behavior and beliefs accordingly to match what is seen - not according to an empirical measure or even to a "tried-and-true formula" [^Note 2]. Whoever controls the reins controls the truth; controls whom we love and hate, what we fear and disgust, how we dress and act.

I noticed how my personality had been nearly eroded unconsciously by emotionally appealing fairy-tales (or rather ideologies) popular among the fueled rabble of the VSE. I would see many such easy to digest, scientifically-ill (and even culturally-ill) apocryphal ideologies, being parroted dogmatically all over the platform. Often warranted with social issues if not sugar-coated with fabricated ones. But even if valid, the ostensibly plausible suggested solution remains far worse than the problem. 

## What doesn't help, probably hurts

It is a choice to leverage technology or get abused by it; a mindless usage can incur lifelong consequences whereas a judicious investment can produce a lifetime fruition. It is a hard choice that can even lie beyond our will, as Schopenhauer eloquently puts it: "man can do what he wills but he cannot will what he wills". 

But unless we dare to question this odious habit, thwart this plot against our attention, and claim our sovereignty back, a myriad of data-hungry algorithms will conspire to keep us captivated to our primal instincts to increase their utility, to dictate how we must live, and all in all, deprive us from discovering and unlocking great hidden potentials within us - we would fail to know life to its fullest. Our boredom must be embraced, not indulgently escaped.

[^Note 1]: By truth I mean the set of assumptions we believe to be valid. The pillars on which we stand to interpret the world and behave.
[^Note 2]: e.g culture.
