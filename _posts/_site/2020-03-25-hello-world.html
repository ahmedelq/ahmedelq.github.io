<p>In mid 2012, I deployed my first website; a rudimentary PHP, MySQL-based hosted at 000webhost on a free .tk domain. What started as a programming hobby turned into a blog, a place where I can finally post things I learnt (which also helped me to learn English), programs I wrote in VB.NET, quotes I like, gallery for my photoshop designs. Although I didn’t announce it to everyone and I kinda kept it a secret, my 14 years old me was proud of it. Then in 2014 I switched to ahmedelq.sa, I kept blogging few times until the free host decided to finally get rid of it.</p>

<p>Now I finally had the time (and energy) to make another blog, and which is more important this time my motive and philosophy of this blog will be different; Wholly, because writing <a href="https://youtu.be/bfDOoADCfkg">improves one’s critical thinking</a>. Moreover, I think some of my private and future writings deserve to be shared for public benefit, as Mohammed (PBUH) once said: “When a man dies, his deeds come to an end except for three things: ceaseless charity; <strong>a knowledge which is beneficial</strong>, or a virtuous descendant who prays for him”. Here I’ll share things I find interesting, opinions, and things I learnt.</p>

<p>Although, I’m a native Arabic speaker, a lot of my writings would be in English. I know I’ll bother some people (Pan-Arabists in particular). Unlike English, I think Arabic -mostly- has a rich, clear and concise vocabulary, I may write bilingual if possible, because why not? One reason for this is because it is international language, secondly I want to improve my English writing, heck, I might even write in German too :), a good way to learn a language is to use it, soak it, and write with it, this could be another reason why I established this blog again. I know a lot of my writings aren’t sleek by the standards, but it’s better than nothing.</p>
