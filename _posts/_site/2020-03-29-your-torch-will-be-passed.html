<p>Consider the ill or good habits that runs your day-to-day routines, they -with great probability- will be passed to your offspring. The strokes you make will be permanent and stronger with each generation. You don’t have control over what the ancestors gave you, but only on inscribing the good, and turning the ill into a palimpsest. When you decide to quit a bad habit or adopt a good one, its positive effects will be passed to your next generations, and vice versa. If you smoke for example, it’s more <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5084564/">likely</a> that your children will take on the same path, from there on it may continue; your children will pass it to your grandchildren and your grandchildren will pass it to your great-grandchildren and so on, all because of you.</p>
