I was just leaving China when the first cases of coronavirus were declared. Quickly, it got out of control infecting almost all of the globe, causing the death of hundreds of thousands. 

Qatif, where the minority Shiites live, was the first Saudi city to be infected (and quarantined) due to pilgrims illegally coming from nearby Iran which hardly did anything to counter the virus. Initially, Iran was reluctant to close the shrines as they would be "houses of cure". Soon, the results of this irrational decision contributed to a horrible outbreak that turned the country into a quagmire; more than 33k infections and over 2.3k deaths. 

In contrast, the Saudi government responded quickly and wisely to mitigate the situation; schools got cancelled, borders got closed, and later a dusk-till-dawn curfew has been imposed. This is how a responsible, rational state should act.

But it doesn't end here. It's the responsibility of us too, the society's awareness is a key solution to resolve this issue. So far, I've seen 3 kinds of people: 

1. The irrational irresponsible 
2. The irrational responsible
3. The rational responsible.

The irrational irresponsible is he who doesn't seem to care, he who does go out and hangs around "like a real man", pretending to be immune against it. It takes only one irrational irresponsible to keep the flames burning. The very act of responsibility abdication made him a coward. 

On the opposite, the irrational responsible is pessimistic anxious and worried, with perhaps compulsive hygienic behavior. He fears everyone and everything like it is the end of humanity.

The rational responsible, on the other hand, takes all the necessary precautions into account. He's courageous for he's protecting himself, his family and the society, and for that reason he'll be labeled as a coward and mocked by the irrational irresponsible. It takes determination to take this path, but i think it worthwhile.
